    <p class="text-left">It happens every year. Just when you think that cold and flu season is coming to an end — blam! — you get hit with a real whopper of a bug that body-slams your immune system. After having spent the winter sampling every medicine for coughs, colds and stuffy noses, don't you think it would be nice to feel better without having to gulp purple syrup from a tiny plastic cup? Lucky us: It turns out that relief from the common cold can be found in a bowl of chicken soup.

Of course, a warming meal always seems to make us feel better. And, yes, our mothers told us it was good for what ailed us. But according to recent research, the healing qualities of chicken soup are more than psychological. During one study conducted at the Mount Sinai Medical Center of Florida, 15 people with colds were divided into three groups. One group sipped hot chicken soup; one group, hot water; and the third group, cold water. It came as no surprise to grandmas across the country that the group sipping hot chicken soup got faster relief from cold symptoms. A subsequent study showed that some hot chicken soup reduced the action of white blood cells that are attracted to areas of inflammation and may cause nasal irritation. Finally, some researchers believe that the curative power of chicken soup comes from chicken skin, which contains an amino acid called cysteine that helps ease the symptoms of respiratory infections.

But who needs medical studies to explain the obvious? Whether you are coping with the sniffles or life in general, there is nothing quite as soothing as a bowl of hot chicken soup. Here are four new recipes to comfort you through the last weeks of winter.
